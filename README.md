# This is a fork of Pokemon Crystal 16 from aaaaaa123456789, specificly the 16 bit pokemon extension. The intent of this project is to reintroduce the various cut pokemon from the earlier stages of Gold/Silver/Crystal as well as reintroduce the GS Ball event and to complete the safari zone. All 251 pokemon are intended to be introduced as well, created a completely restored Crystal with several new pokemon and features.

Mew Idea:
    I've got a great idea
    tweak Cinnabar a little, add a truck that survived
    under the truck, key item, scrap from the pokemon mansion
    “…ber, 6th day
    If any human…sets foot here…
    again…et it be a kindhearted pers…
    …ith that hope, I depar…”

    Mewtwo Requirement
    tweaked version of the sign from faraway island, add back in the "...-ji" part missing from the en version
    that points to Mr. Fuji, talk to him, he remembers the past screen, black out, gives you a new key item, old sea map
    take that to fast ship, that takes you to faraway island
    this loops the mansion, fuji, the movie, and faraway island back to mew
